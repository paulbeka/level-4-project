## Guidance

* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

## Week 1

## Week 2

### 5 Oct 2022
* *3 hours* Literature search, started writing a recap

### 6 Oct 2022
* *2 hours* worked on upcoming meeting + literature search

### 7 Oct 2022

### 11 Oct 2022
* *4 hours* decided I want to search for spaceships, researched wikis, found useful modules to use later


## Week 3

### 12 Oct 2022
* *2 hours*  Researched deep learning in GoL. Worked on the aims part of the paper, as well as found new way to do brute force

### 13 Oct 2022
* *1 hour* worked on a GoL structure detection algorithm
* *1 hour* Figured out a way to detect structures & now working on calculating utility

### 14 Oct 2022
* *1 hour* Worked on the brute force program. Little progress.
* *1 hour* met with supervisor and looked over what was said
